# DogFinder

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app but instead of dating you find your foreve dog. This full-stack site will take in results your users' surveys and store them. The app will then display the name and picture with the best overall match.

This was also deployed in Heroku.
